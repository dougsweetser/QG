## Measuring while up or down page-cast

Hello, I'm Doug
This is the Measurement 101 page cast
3 minutes talking about a particular web page
In this case, the measure while up or down in a gravity field page
or equivalently, my new proposal, the quaternion gravity page.

There are two supernove events.

The reference observer, me,  says time dt = 5.
space dR = 3.
Do the square to find
the interval = 16 and the space-times-time = 30.
That is the starting point.

Hello, I am quaternion gravity Doug in yellow
Everything kelly green on this page is about quaternion gravity.
A quaternion squared is the interval and space-times-time
An invariant space-times-time is quaternion gravity.

What does that mean?

Focus on the girl floating with the balloons.
She is not slowed down by heavy gravity, so her clock ticks faster.
Her time dt with the speeding clock 
is bigger than the reference observer.
Her ruler expands up in the clouds.
Her space dR measurement with the bigger ruler is smaller

These changes are very precise.
In the standard approach to gravity called Einsteinâ€™s General relativity,
the bigger time dt
almost cancels the smaller space dR.

In my quaternion gravity proposal,
the bigger time dt exactly cancels the smaller space dR.
The result is an invariant space-times-time = 30.

The interval is made up of one positive number that gets bigger,
minus a number that gets number. 
The result is an interval that is larger 
than the reference interval.

Focus on the guy lying down, pointing at each event.
His clock ticks slower.
His time dt with the slow clock is smaller than the reference observer.
His meter stick is smaller.
His space dR with the smaller stick is larger than the reference observer.
The result is the invariant space-times-time = 30.

The interval of a smaller positive number minus a larger negative number
means the interval is smaller than the reference interval.

That's it for this page cast.
