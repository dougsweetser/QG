# Measurements in spacetime

Measurements of time and measurements of space combine to make a measurement in
spacetime.

Just square it.

The first term is called the interval. If that does not change - is an
invariant - then one is dealing with __S__pecial __R__elativity (SR).

The next three terms do not have a name, so I made one up: __space-times-time__.
If those three numbers do not change - is an invariant - then that is my
proposal for a new approach to gravity, __Q__uaternion __G__ravity (QG).

Four observers of the events were looked at.

1. Walking toward the events (SR)
1. Walking away from the events (SR)
1. Watching from above the events (QG)
1. Watching from below the events (QG)

The walkers measured the same interval, but calculated different
space-times-times.  

The above and below observers agreed on the space-times-time, but differed on 
the interval.

The precise amounts of the differences - and they are exceedingly precise -
depends on more math than shown in the graphics.  One would need to read the
essay for that.
