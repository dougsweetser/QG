# How this was done

It all began with studying quaternions for many years...

Then I had a daughter. How could I explain my work to her?

That requires blocks and straws. The blocks were in the house. The huge number of straws for the cube cost about $100 from Amazon. While watching "The Big Bang Theory" with my wife, I sawed straws and stuck them together.

The photos were taking using a Nexus 5 cell phone mounted on a monopod kept in place with a Black & Decker Workmate.

Software was written in python to merge the photos together. The project, [simply_animate_math](https://github.com/dougsweetser/simply_animate_math), is publicly available on github.

This site was generated using **mkdocs**, a great program for a simple static site like this one.
