Start with the reference square which has an interval of 16 and a space-times
time of 30.

Compare the reference square with the walkers.  They all have the same interval
of 16 because that in what is invariant for inertial observers, folks moving at
a constant speed compared to the reference.

Compare the reference square with the girl above and boy below.  Because they
are in a gravitational field, they are not inertial observers.  The quaternion
gravity proposal says the space-times-time value are exactly the same at 30.
The interval will be of different sizes.

If one compares a walker to one of the kids above or below, there is no overlap
between them.

## For nerds

Since there is a gravitational field everywhere, there are no inertial
observers.  Working with the squares of quaternions, things are a little
easier.  Just compare the reference square with any other square.  For the
walkers, since they travel at a constant speed and are at the same location in
the gravitational field as the reference square, they will have the same
interval.

The kids above and below are not moving compared to the reference square.  By
the quaternion gravity proposal, the space-times-time is an invariant.  All
agree on the value of 30.  What then has to be different is the interval.  But
how different, and how does that depend on the gravitational source mass?

My entry to the [_2015 Awards for Essays on 
Gravitation_](http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/index.html) tries to
address those questions. [available as a
pdf](papers/s-t-t/space-times-time-invariance.pdf).
