# Measure it all page-cast

Hello, I'm Doug
This is a Measurement 101 page-cast
3 minutes talking about a particular web page
In this case, the measure it all page,
or *S*pecial *R*elativity and *Q*uaternion *G*ravity

This graphic says too much.
It is a 3 hat affair.

A quaternion squared equals
the interval and space-times-time.

An equivalent interval is the equivalence class of special relativity.
It is the stuff in blue.
An equivalent space-times-time is the equivalence class of quaternion gravity.
It is the stuff in Kelly green.

I am the reference observer,
There are the stars that go supernove.
The time dt between them is 5
The space dR between them is 3.
The square give an interval of 16,
a space-times-time of 30.

Everyone compares their measurements to me.

I am special realtivity Doug in blue.
Focus on the walkers.
Ignore the view from above and below.
They all have the same inverval of 16.
That is special relativity.

I am quaternion gravity Doug in yellow.
Focus on the measuremtns from above and below.
Ignore the walkers.
They all have the same space-times-time of 30.
That is my quaternion gravity proposal.

The kids walking don't agree with the 
kids above and below about anything.
The intervals are different 
and the space-times-time is different.
That is OK.
What matters is the different agreements
the kids make with me, the reference observer.
The walkers agree about the interval.
That is speical relativity.
The kids above and below agree about space-times-time.
That is quaternion gravity.

That's it for this page-cast.
