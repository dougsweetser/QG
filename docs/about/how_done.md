# How This Was Done

It all began with studying quaternions for many years...

Then I had a daughter. How could I explain my work to her?

Elle and I collaborated on the drawings. She drew two figures, and I did (the
ones with the more youthful color palette are hers).

The web site was generated using mkdocs, a great program for sites with static
content.
