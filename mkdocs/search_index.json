I view that as my \"born \nagain\" moment, one based on physics, not the Bible. For a month long period, my \nmind kept rearranging information, sure that everything somehow made sense. I \nwas aware I was babbling - saying words that are part of the lexicon of \nphysics, but would not make sense to an actual physicist. I decide to keep a \nday job, but work study physics in the background.\n\n\nBoston was the perfect city in the 1990s to study physics on the side. I took a \nHarvard Extension class on Special Relativity taught by Edwin F. Taylor as he \nwas writing the book \"Spacetime Physics\" with Johnathon Wheeler. Taylor would \nbring in a new chapter from Copy Copy, and we were assigned to critique it.\n\nThus became my respectful skeptical analysis of physics. I decide to keep a day \njob, but work study physics in the background.\n\n\nI was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked \nat MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was \nI did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I \nhad were a few math widgets.\n\n\nFirst work on quaternions\n\n\nIn the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated \nnewsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief \ndefinition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and \nneeded to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort \nof number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to \nreread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about \nquaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion:\n\n\n\n\nTo this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of \nspecial relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free.\n\nThat cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain \nquaternions.com.\n\n\nMajor failure at a unified field theory\n\n\nI struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions.\n\nOne lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric \ntheory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one \nhappens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric \noperation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a \nhandedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers.\n\nThose have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs \nanywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric.\n\n\nI confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was \ndifficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging \non Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I \nfinally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers \nobjected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the \nproposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from \nquaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve \nangular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will \nchange under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of \nequal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular \nmomentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the \nLagrangian is wrong. End of story.\n\n\nCurrent research\n\n\nWeb sites:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternions.com\n, the mothership of my private\n  research project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers 101\n, a visual introduction to space-time\n  numbers, aka quaternions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement 101\n, a site dedicated to my new proposal \nfor quaternion gravity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualPhysics.org\n has a collection of analytic \n  animations generated with a user-hostile set of tools I wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuaternion space-times-time equivalence classes as gravity\n\n\nI went back to the equation that sparked my initial interest in quaternions:\n\n\n\n\nThe first term is called the interval. But what are the next three called? \nPhysics doesn't have a name. That is a problem because the first term is one of \nthe most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity.\n\nI came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I \nasked a simple question: what if space-times-time for two observers was\nequivalent, then what sort of physics results? That could be gravity, but a\nvery different theory because it is not a field theory. There would be no\ngraviton, nor any quantum gravity theory. The idea had enough promise that I\nsubmitted an 1500 word paper to the 2015 Gravitation Research Foundation Essay \non Gravity.  We will see if they like it (no, they did not).",

I decide to keep a day \njob, but work study physics in the background.  I was able to show some of my earliest efforts to a famous physicist who worked \nat MIT. He said it was \"interesting, but not very interesting\". The reason was \nI did not have a theory, a means to make many calculations. At the time, all I \nhad were a few math widgets.",

            "text": "In the struggle to find a theory, I held a small contest on a moderated \nnewsgroup, sci.physics.research in 1997. I asked readers to provide a brief \ndefinition of time. It had to be about math or physics, not philosophy, and \nneeded to be two sentences or less. In one math book, I recalled some odd sort \nof number that was like a scalar and a vector. The contest motivated me to \nreread that passage, then go to an old-fashion library and read up about \nquaternions. This was the first equation I saw, the squaring of a quaternion:   To this day, this makes me excited because the first term is at the core of \nspecial relativity as taught to me by Edwin F. Taylor. It is there, for free. \nThat cannot be an accident. That observation drove me to purchase the domain \nquaternions.com.",

            "text": "I struggled to come up with a way to deal with gravity using only quaternions. \nOne lesson from general relativity is that a theory of gravity must be a metric \ntheory - a theory where the calculation of distance depends on where one \nhappens to be in a gravitational field. Measuring distance is a symmetric \noperation, meaning there is no handed to doing the work. Quaternions do have a \nhandedness. There is no way around that. So I reinvented hypercomplex numbers. \nThose have all the same multiplication rules as quaternions, but no minus signs \nanywhere. As such, hypercomplex numbers could be used to characterize a metric.  I confess to having pride in the proposal, enough to print up t-shirts. It was \ndifficult to find a professional to review the body of work. I began blogging \non Science20.com. There I found a few technically skilled readers. When I \nfinally got to presenting what I called the GEM proposal, several readers \nobjected to the work. It took a little over a month for me to really see the \nproposal like they did. The flaw was deadly. A Lagrangian constructed from \nquaternions will not change under a rotation. It will therefore conserve \nangular momentum. A Lagrangian constructed from hypercomplex numbers will \nchange under a rotation. It will not conserve angular momentum. Kepler's law of \nequal area in equal time is a statement that gravity conserves angular \nmomentum. Thus a proposal for gravity using hypercomplex number in the \nLagrangian is wrong.

But what are the next three called? \nPhysics doesn't have a name. That is a problem because the first term is one of \nthe most important in physics because it is at the heart of special relativity. \nI came up with a reasonable name for the three amigos: space-times-time. I \nasked a simple question: what if space-times-time for two observers was\nequivalent, then what sort of physics results? That could be gravity, but a\nvery different theory because it is not a field theory. There would be no\ngraviton, nor any quantum gravity theory. The idea had enough promise that I\nsubmitted an 1500 word paper to the 2015 Gravitation Research Foundation Essay \non Gravity.  We will see if they like it (no, they did not).",
