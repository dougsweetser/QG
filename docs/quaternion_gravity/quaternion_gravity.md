# Quaternion gravity

Looking down or looking up from below changes time and space measurements in opposite ways.

If one kid is at a different height in a gravity field to another, then
time measurements get smaller while spatial ones get bigger. That is standard 
physics (general relativity, GR).

The Quaternion Gravity (QG) proposal says the space-times-time values are 
precisely the same. With general relativity, this space-times-time is not 
mentioned, but it is almost - but not quite - the same.

Note: the numbers are **far too big**.

## For nerds

Special relativity could have been called "special equivalence" because it is
the interval that all inertial observers agree upon forming an equivalence
class. An equivalence class is a deep insights into how Nature works.

The quaternion gravity proposal postulates a new equivalence class: that
different observers making measurements in different locations in a
gravitational field will agree on the value for space-times-time.
Some care is required to say this in a coordinate-independent way. All
observers are free to pick their coordinate system. There then exists a
norm-preserving rotation in space such that the space-times-time measurement of
one observer is exactly equal to another.

But how precisely does the interval change? For a spherically symmetric,
non-rotating, uncharged source, only one dimensionless ratio comes into play:
GM/c^2^R. The requirement that the
space-times-time term is equivalent means the the changes in the time term must
be the mathematical inverse of the changes in space. To be consistent with
Newton's law of gravity, the simplest functions would be (1 - 2 GM/c^2 R) for
time, and 1/(1 - 2 GM/c^2 R) for space. To be consistent with weak field test
of gravity, one more term must be added to both: (1 - 2 GM/c^2 R + 2 (GM/c^2 R)^2)
for time and its inverse for space. At this point, quaternion gravity disagrees
with general relativity because such terms do not solve the Einstein field
equations. Orbital systems are harmonic systems, suggesting that one use
exponential of the dimensionless ratio.

![e to the -z dt, e to the z dR sub i over c squared equals e to the -2 z dt
squared - e to the 2 z dR sub i squared, 2 dt dR sub i over c equals e to the -
2 G M c squared R dt squared - e to the 2 G M over c squared R dR sub i
squared, 2 dt dR sub i if z = G M over c squared R](../images/exp_GMc2R.png)

The resulting exponential interval has the same form as the Rosen metric. The Rosen
metric makes the same experimental predictions as the Schwarzschild metric for
all weak field gravity tests to first order Parameterize Post-Newtonian (PPN)
accuracy. At second order PPN accuracy, the exponential interval predicts 6%
more bending of light around the Sun. We have yet to achieve the precision to 
decide this issue on experimental data.

Special relativity is not a field theory. It is a constraint on all
field theories. The quaternion gravity proposal is also not a field theory.
Quaternion gravity is a constraint on all field theories. As such,
there is no need for a graviton. Quaternion gravity makes the search for
quantum gravity moot.
