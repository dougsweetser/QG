Hello, I'm Doug
This is a Measurement 101 page cast
About 3 minutes talking about a particular web page
In this case, the measure it all page,
or *S*pecial *R*elativity and *Q*uaternion *G*ravity

This graphic says too much.
It is a 3 hat affair.

The black hat is the reference observer,
there with the stars as they go supernove.
The time dt = 5, the space dR = 3.
The square give an interval of 16,
a space-times-time of 30.

Focus on the walkers.
Ignore the view from above and below.
They all have the same inverval of 16.
That is special relativity.

Switch to the view from above and below.
Ignore the walkers.
They all have the same space-times-time of 30.
That is my quaternion gravity proposal.

Bring everyone back.
The walks don't agree with the 
kids above and below about anything.
That is OK.

That's it for this page-cast.
