## Landing page

Hello, I'm Doug
This is a Measurement 101 page-cast,
3 minutes talking about a web page on this site
In this case, the landing page

This site is all about measurement of events in space-time.

We were raised on the idea that absolute space and
absolute time have _no_ relationship.

In 1905, Einstein proposed space marry time.
This is a hard marriage to understand, even today.

On this page, two stars go supernova
Those are the events in space-time

There is one time when the star explodes, then another
There is a difference in time.

There is a difference in space because the stars
are at different location.

Together they make a difference in space-time.

Four kids watch.
Each kid measures a different values for time and space.
No measurements are the same, period.
This site describes what the 4 kids can agree upon.

I am the reference observer (the hat gives it away)
The reference is not moving, right there with the events themselves
The kids will be ignored, just focus on the center

What does one do with measurements anyway?

I do somthing both simple and unusual:
I square the difference between events in space-time.

That is not a legal move with standard physics.
I use a math where squaring events in space-time is OK.

The dt^2^ - dR^2^ is called the interval

I like to make things concrete, so made up numbers
    5 for time dt
    3 for space dR
The interval is 5^2^ 25 - 3^2^ 9 16

The other term, 2 dt dR, doesn't even have a name in standard physics
I call it space-times-time
    2 times 3  5 = 30

The walkers agree about the interval.
This is the physics of special relativity

The above and below kids agree on the space-times-time
This is my new proposal, quaternion gravity.

That's it for this page-cast.
